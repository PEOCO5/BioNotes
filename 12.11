Aim: How is the science of genetics applied?
HW: 2 articles(Name, Topic, Type of article, Year- 2014)
Inbreeding is mating closely related individuals for a desired trait
Hybridization: Mating 2 individuals not related to achive new beneficial genes
Hybridization also results in mules not being able to reproduce, but gives stronger mules
In oranges or seedless fruit they stick 2 branches together to make dope seedless oranges!!
Himalayain rabbits are homozygous to Ch allele
Ch produces heat sensitive tyrosinase(prouces melanin)
Tyrosinase will make rabbit fur darker
Tyrosinase activates at colder temps
Nanometers are a small unit of measurement
An average microrganism is 1000 nanometers
E. coli in the intestine is good
Baby cows have more milk in intestines
ALL COWS ARE FEMALE
Males do not produce milk
Gene regulation - Baby cows need enzymes to break down milk sugars
When bacterial cells are in an enviroment with no milk sugar, they will not make the enzymes to break down milk sugar. In baby cows, or envrioments with milk sugar, it will make enzymes to break down milk sugar.
The Milk sugar regulates genes.
Operon: a group of genes that work together
The Lac Operon is a group of bacteria that makes 3 enzymes to break down milk sugar.
Gene regulation is simpler in prokaryotes, they do not have a nucleus.
Making of proteins can happen anywhere in the cell
Why do Cells divide?
Cells need to divide because if they get too big, they need more energy
Binary Fission: a cell divides, and results in 2 new organisms identical to the parent: Asexual repreduction
1 cell becomes 2 identical Cells
The original cell become part of the 2 Cells
Budding: A new organsim is formed from an uneven division of the cytoplasm: yeast
DNA duplicates and moves into cells in both
Pant cells divide by mitosis to produce more, identical cells
Cells usully divide when they reach a certain size
some cells never divide
cell cycle: a series of steps leading to cell division
Generation time: the time required to complete 1 cell cycle
Mitosis is the replication and division of the nucleus
cytokinesis: the division of the cytoplasm
Interphase is the steps leading up to mitosis
G1: the cell grows in size; number of organelles and enzyme activity increase. No DNA replication
Non-Dividing G0
S: DNA and proteins synthesis
G2: increased protein synthesis
Interphase includes all G1, S, and G2
M Stage has mitosis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase
